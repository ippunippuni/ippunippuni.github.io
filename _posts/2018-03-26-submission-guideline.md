Submission guideline to NECO'18 is just updated! 

Two important changes: 

1. The submission due is extended to April 30th, 2018. (Anywhere in the world)

2. The submitted works will not be included in the conference proceedings as AAAI passed a new policy, making this a good opportunity for discussing works in progress.
