#### "Tweeting Left, Right & Center: How users and attention are distributed across Twitter" ####
Abstract: More than 48 million Americans use Twitter, one of the most popular social networking platforms, and one used extensively by media and political junkies. This study analyzed more than 86 million tweets posted in 2017 to reveal how users from across the political spectrum engage differently with news issues and major media outlets on Twitter. We assigned randomly-sampled users ideology scores based on who they follow, then divided them into four segments: extreme left, center left, center right, and extreme right. This talk is based on a report commissioned by the Knight Foundation and will discuss its key findings.

#### "If a Tree Falls in the Forest: COVID-19, Media Choices, and Presidential Agenda Setting" ####
Abstract: During the COVID-19 crisis, political observers noted the dangers of a misinformed or under-informed population. President Trump’s daily press briefings, often covered live, offer a stark example of the potential exposure to misinformation. We use complete transcripts of national cable news, network news and local news from around 800 local TV channels across all 210 Designated Media Areas to examine the media narratives consumed by the public. We use web search data to examine the effects of media coverage on information search and behavior. We find that while the direct effects of Trump press conferences on contemporaneous internet search are weak, these conferences tend to direct media coverage for the next 24 hours post-conference, which in turn drives greater search volume. These effects are stronger for more polarized topics, including Chinese culpability for the pandemic and the use of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19. Different TV news outlets show disparate responsiveness to Trump’s press conferences, with cable news as most responsive and local news as least. Local news tends to focus on softer news, and eschews the partisan debates prevalent in cable coverage. These results demonstrate the power of the media as a disseminator of public health messaging and a mediator of presidential agenda setting.
