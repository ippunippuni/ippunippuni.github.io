**Dr. Jisun An** is a scientist at Qatar Computing Research Institute, HBKU. She is interested in doing data science in the area of journalism, politics, health, and computational social science. The research she does is highly interdisciplinary, which only can be achieved by combining theoretical foundations, computational methods such as NLP and machine learning, and massive computing capability. She received her Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge, UK in 2015. For her study, she was funded by EPSRC and she is now an honorable recipient of Google European Scholarship. She has been a member of the PC of major computer science conferences and computational social science conferences, including ICWSM 2012-20, WWW 2016-20, SocInfo 2014-17/20, IC2S2 2016-20. She also has been organizing a workshop on News and Public Opinion (NECO) 2016-18.

He is a lead author of “What is Twitter, a social network or news media?” (WWW 2010), which has been cited more than 7,000 times.  His work has been featured by Nature News, ACM Tech News, BBC, The Times, The Economist, Slate, Scientific American, and so on.  He was a chair of social networks and graph analysis track in WWW 2016 and has been a program committee member for top conferences, including ICWSM and The Web.  He is also an editorial board member for Online Social Networks and Media (Elsevier) and Digital Journalism (T&F). 


**Dr. Fabrício Benevenuto** is an associate professor in the Computer Science Department of Federal University at Minas Gerais (UFMG). Recently, Fabrício received a prestigious scholarship from Humboldt foundation through which he was visiting faculty at MPI-SWS, Germany. His research on online social networks has resulted in many widely cited papers (i.e. h-index 39).   He is at the senior PC of ICWSM and he was ICWSM data co-chair (2016, 2017,  2018, and 2020). The innovative aspect of his research has attracted the attention of several specialized blogs and mass media channels such as The New York Times, BBC, The Huffington Post, MIT Tech Review, and New Scientist.
