We solicit both full (8-page long) and short (4-page long) research papers that will present original, previously unpublished, research. They must be at most 8- or 4-page long, including figures and references. All papers must follow AAAI formatting guidelines. Formatting instructions are available via the [2016 AAAI Press Author Kit](http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit16.zip).

Full paper authors will be allowed 25 minutes total (about a 20 minute talk with 5 minutes of questions) to present their work. Short paper authors will be allowed 15 minutes (about a 12-minute talk with 3 minutes of questions) to present their work.

All accepted papers will be included in ICWSM workshop proceedings. However, you can opt out from the publication if you do not want to publish the work.
