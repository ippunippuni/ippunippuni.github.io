**Format**

We solicit both full papers (6 to 8 pages) and extended abstracts (2 to 4 pages) that will present original, previously unpublished, research. All papers must follow AAAI formatting guidelines. Formatting instructions are available via the [2018 AAAI Press Author Kit](http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit18.zip).

Full paper authors will be allowed 25 minutes total (about a 20 minute talk with 5 minutes of questions) to present their work. Short paper authors will be allowed 15 minutes (about a 12-minute talk with 3 minutes of questions) to present their work.

Please note that the accepted paper will not be published. AAAI passed a new policy regarding the papers for all of its workshops and AAAI will no longer be publishing the technical reports for its workshops.
